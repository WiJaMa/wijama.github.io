Li Keqiang was the former premier of the People's Republic of China. He was seen by many in the West as a moderate in the Chinese Communist Party; compared to Xi Jinping, Li was more friendly to the West and more open to liberal economics. He was widely expected to be a major candidate to succeed Hu Jintao in 2012.
However, he fell from grace, in large part due to a diplomatic cable stolen and leaked by Wikileaks in 2010. In this document, an ambassador claims to have been told by Li Keqiang that the GDP figures in Li's province of Liaoning were unreliable. Instead, Li said that he used three other indicators: the railway cargo volume, electricity consumption and loans disbursed by banks.
This was widely reported at the time, most famously by [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/asia/2010/12/09/keqiang-ker-ching).
